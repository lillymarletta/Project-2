This system is supposed to mimic a car headlight mode selector. Within this system, there are two subsystems, 
  the ignition and the headlights. In the ignition subsystem, the car can only start if the driver is sitting down, but stays running
  even when the driver leaves the seat. In the headlight subsystem, the potentiometer is used to select between three different 
  modes for headlights, one being off, one being on, and one being auto. The on and off modes are pretty self explanitory,
  but the auto mode uses the light sensor to turn the headlights on or off depending on the darkness levels. Only when the car is running
  is the user able to turn on the headlights. 

No starting repositiory was used, however some of the code was derived from project 1, the light sensor module we added in class, and the
  entryway light module we added in class.
